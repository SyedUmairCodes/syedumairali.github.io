The 26th of January, 2024 marks exactly one month of me writing a daily journal and it truly has been life-changing. I got insights into where most my time is spent, whom I spent it with, what I ate, and the things that I have done on a weekly, daily, and monthly basis. 

My mental health and overall mood has also improved, I can just write down anything I want in my journal since I don't want to talk to people about my thoughts and feelings. Overall, journalling has been really great for both my mental and somewhat physical health as well. I'm glad I really started this.
